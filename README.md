# Overview

I am trying to learn more about lower-level languages and how they interact with the computer in order to further my 
learning, but also to increase my skill-set. My goals with this software is to further my learning regarding 
lower-level languages. I also wanted to learn more how C++ manages memory with pointers and how they can be used to 
develop a somewhat-complex project.

This project uses the C++ language to implement a fully functioning chess game. This software is a simple chess game 
that is played in the console. Players take turns moving pieces one-by-one using the CLI. The game includes check/checkmate 
detection, pawn promotion and en passant, and piece movement/capture. The project uses derived/abstract classes for all
the pieces. The purpose of this project was to learn how to make a more complex project in C++ while learning a bit of
C++. The project was also to learn how chess games (and their more complex logic) are implemented in a programming sense.

# Development Environment

The project was built using C++17 and CMake using CLion by JetBrains. The project does not include external libraries 
except those provided by the Standard Library (STL). The project can be built and run using CMake.

# Future Work

- A GUI, rather than a CLI
- Saving/loading games
- Stalemate detection
